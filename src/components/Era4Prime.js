          The year 2020 was a remarkable one for me, as I embraced new
          challenges and opportunities. I learned how to be resilient and
          innovative in a dynamic world. I worked diligently to provide vital
          support and resources to people through art and odd jobs, whether it
          was cutting-edge hardware, generous benefits, or compassionate
          assistance. I experienced the joy and satisfaction of serving others
          through my work. I also had overcome my own unforeseen circumstances.

          During that time, I realized that I had to make the best of what I
          had, and not let fear or uncertainty stop me from pursuing my dreams.
          I invested in a laptop that enabled me to do everything I wanted to
          do, from working remotely to creating art. I bought my first car, I
          started making art for myself. I saw things start to improve for me,
          as I gained more confidence and recognition for my work.

          I ignited a new flame of creativity after relocating to North
          Carolina. I was grinding to make a living with diverse gigs and
          commissions. Then, in June of 2022, something awakened me. I realized
          what I wanted to do. NFTs were not as trendy as they used to be, but
          that was also a chance to start anew. I committed myself to making a
          piece every day and never quitting.

          My work is a reflection of my inner world, where I explore the
          contrasts and complexities of human emotions. I feel the solitude of
          the soul, the intensity of the passions, and the resolve of the will.
          I embrace a motto: “At war with entropy”, which captures the essence
          of our existence. We defy the inevitable decay and dissolution, we
          strive to create and persevere, we fight. This is the story I tell
          through every piece I create.

            End of 2020, Audius had airdropped quite a few tokens to active
            members of the community. Considering that Ah! Hermes was still
            active digitally at the time, all of us had transitioned to the
            platform. I decided to convert the tokens to Ethereum, from there I
            found out about the NFT market in February of 2021, joining this
            Telegram Community named Art Gallery Auction House, setting up my
            MetaMask wallet, and selling my genesis piece on the marketplace
            called Rarible.

            This space has opened up a new world of possibilities for me as an
            artist. I have been able to sell my creations for more than I ever
            dreamed of. The digital economy is no longer a fantasy, but a
            reality. For years, I have been honing my skills and building my
            social currency, but there was never a real market for digital art
            beyond conventional commissions. Now, I have sold pieces for
            thousands of dollars, and they are all personal works that reflect
            my vision and passion. I realized that this art is eternal. A flame
            that was about to die out has been rekindled with more intensity
            than ever.

            This piece was collected by SurrealSerpentine, but it also had a
            profound impact on my artistic journey. When I created it, I felt a
            surge of confidence and excitement. I sensed that this would be the

            This piece was a milestone in my artistic journey. I had been
            struggling with a lack of inspiration and motivation, and I had
            stopped creating art for a long period of time. I had a strong
            conviction that my work deserved a 1 ETH floor price, but that also
            meant that my pieces did not find any buyers for a while. I felt
            discouraged and doubtful about my future as an artist.

            This breakthrough moment came from a dear friend named Leeaux. He
            was an amazing artist who excelled in various fields and mediums. He
            had been a loyal supporter and a source of encouragement for me from
            the beginning. He saw something in my work that I had lost sight of.
            He decided to buy this piece and give me the recognition and
            validation that I needed. I will always be thankful, as this
            reignited the passion and creativity that I needed to move forward.

            𝐔𝐋𝐓𝐑𝐀𝐌𝐀𝐑𝐈𝐍𝐄 (əltrəməˈrēn / pisces / waterbaby) is a collaborative
            project that features Tetra as the recording artist & engineer and
            Joven as the lead producer & engineer. It was started in the Bronx,
            NY, and completed in Chicago, IL. It explores the creation of man in
            their most natural element, through a transformative journey. The
            project blends experimental Caribbean sounds with the essence of
            Bronx boom-bap type flows. It is a short, yet rich journey of
            natives pushing the boundaries of traditional rap music.

            Garnet was the first official album that I released on all music
            streaming platforms, introducing myself as a solo artist and an
            engineer to the world. It was a reflection of all the lessons and
            experiences I had gained from collaborating with amazing engineers
            and fellow artists who inspired me and helped me grow. It featured a
            diverse range of beats from OXVX, Navan, Remilia, MXXXY, Yung
            Paneer, and captivating vocals from Joven and Yeeevs. Put together
            all in Tetra HQ.

          I made a bet at the end of 2020 that if these GME Options paid off
          then we'd go on vacation. We ended up hitting Lake Wallenpaupack,
          going on a beautiful winterized retreat. It was a nice break from it
          all, a great start after a rollercoaster of a year. We traversed a
          frozen lake, eating local foods, watching the soft flurry, doing
          donuts in the snow. It was the perfect start to new year among
          friends.

        <p className="text-neutral-400 text-sm mb-6">
          Throughout the year of 2021, I traveled across Chicago and Charlotte,
          knocking on doors and pitching products as a salesperson. It was a
          grueling and exhausting job, but it also sparked my interest in a new
          form of artistic expression: minting NFTs. I was fascinated by the
          possibilities of digital art and blockchain technology, and I wanted
          to explore them more. So, by the end of the year, I made a bold
          decision: I quit my sales job and took some time off to figure out my
          situation with creating art.
        </p>
        <p className="text-neutral-400 text-sm mb-6">
          I didn’t produce any new pieces during that period, but I felt that
          the break was necessary for my well-being and creativity. Now, I am a
          thriving full-time artist, living my dream and sharing my vision with
          the world. But I also know that I have a long way to go, and that I
          need to keep learning and growing as an artist. I am grateful for the
          journey that led me here, and I am excited for the future that awaits
          me.

            As soon as I returned with my whip, we cruised up to this dope park
            that Yeeevs had put me on. We snapped some fire pics for the debut
            album I was about to drop and they turned out legendary.

            We celebrated the successful launch of Collection 3 for Timeless,
            despite the global crisis that occurred in the same month. We rose
            above the difficulties of lockdowns, supply chain disruptions in
            creative ways, making the best out of the situation.
