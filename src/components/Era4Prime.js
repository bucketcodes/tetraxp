          The year 2020 was a transformative one for me, as I faced
          unprecedented challenges and opportunities. I learned how to adapt and
          thrive in a rapidly changing world, while also helping others cope
          with the crisis. I worked hard to provide essential support and
          resources to people struggling with the pandemic, whether it was new
          hardware, benefits, or emotional assistance. I discovered the joy and
          fulfillment of serving others through my work. I also had to deal with
          my own unexpected situations.
        </p>
        <p className="text-neutral-400 text-sm mb-3">
          During that time, I realized that I had to make the best of what I
          had, and not let fear or uncertainty stop me from pursuing my dreams.
          I invested in a laptop that enabled me to do everything I wanted to
          do, from working remotely to creating art. I bought my first car, I
          started making art for myself. I saw things start to improve for me,
          as I gained more confidence and recognition for my work.

          I had fallen into a creative slumber after settling down in North
          Carolina. I was struggling to make ends meet with random gigs and
          commissions. Then, in June of 2022, something clicked in me. I
          realized what I wanted to do. NFTs were not as hot as they used to be,
          but that was also a chance to start fresh. I committed to making a
          piece every day and never turning back.

          My work is a reflection of my inner world, where I explore the
          contrasts and complexities of human emotions. I feel the solitude of
          the soul, the intensity of the passions, and the resolve of the will.
          I embrace a motto: “At war with entropy”, which captures the essence
          of our existence. We defy the inevitable decay and dissolution, we
          strive to create and preserve, even though we know that death awaits
          us all. The war with entropy is a hopeless one, but we fight. This is
          the story I tell through every piece I create.

          End of 2020, Audius had airdropped quite a few tokens to active
          members of the community. Considering that Ah! Hermes was still active
          digitally at the time, all of us had transitioned to the platform. I
          decided to convert the tokens to Ethereum, from there I found out
          about the NFT market in February of 2021, joining this Telegram
          Community named Art Gallery Auction House, setting up my MetaMask
          wallet, and selling my genesis piece on the marketplace called
          Rarible.

          This space has opened up a new world of possibilities for me as an
          artist. I have been able to sell my creations for more than I ever
          dreamed of. The digital economy is no longer a fantasy, but a reality.
          For years, I have been honing my skills and building my social
          currency, but there was never a real market for digital art beyond
          conventional commissions. Now, I have sold pieces for thousands of
          dollars, and they are all personal works that reflect my vision and
          passion. I realized that this art is eternal. A flame that was about
          to die out has been rekindled with more intensity than ever.

          𝐔𝐋𝐓𝐑𝐀𝐌𝐀𝐑𝐈𝐍𝐄 (əltrəməˈrēn / pisces / waterbaby) is a collaborative
          project that features Tetra as the recording artist & engineer and
          Joven as the lead producer & engineer. It was started in the Bronx,
          NY, and completed in Chicago, IL. It explores the creation of man in
          their most natural element, through a transformative journey. The
          project blends experimental Caribbean sounds with the essence of Bronx
          boom-bap type flows. It is a short, yet rich journey of natives
          pushing the boundaries of traditional rap music.

          Garnet was the first official album that I released on all music
          streaming platforms, introducing myself as a solo artist and an
          engineer to the world. It was a reflection of all the lessons and
          experiences I had gained from collaborating with amazing engineers and
          fellow artists who inspired me and helped me grow. It featured a
          diverse range of beats from OXVX, Navan, Remilia, MXXXY, Yung Paneer,
          and captivating vocals from Joven and Yeeevs. Put together all in
          Tetra HQ.

          The beginning of 2021 was another surreal experience. I had invested
          heavily on Gamestop stock back in December. My options were for
          January 15th, they were worthless just before a week of expiration.
          Three days prior to expiration, that's when everything changed. It was
          the only time I 30X'd an investment in so little time, I bet that if
          it paid off we'd take a trip, so we went to Lake Wallenpaupack.

          Throughout the year of 2021, I traveled across Chicago and Charlotte,
          knocking on doors and pitching products as a salesperson. It was a
          grueling and exhausting job, but it also sparked my interest in a new
          form of artistic expression: minting NFTs. I was fascinated by the
          possibilities of digital art and blockchain technology, and I wanted
          to explore them more. So, by the end of the year, I made a bold
          decision: I quit my sales job and took some time off to figure out my
          situation with creating art.
        </p>
        <p className="text-neutral-400 text-sm mb-6">
          I didn’t produce any new pieces during that period, but I felt that
          the break was necessary for my well-being and creativity. Now, I am a
          thriving full-time artist, living my dream and sharing my vision with
          the world. But I also know that I have a long way to go, and that I
          need to keep learning and growing as an artist. I am grateful for the
          journey that led me here, and I am excited for the future that awaits
          me.
