          I overcame many obstacles and hardships in my life. It was a period of
          transition, discovery, and personal development. I witnessed many
          friends come and go, family moving on, and the shifting of values in
          the world. But I also discovered a passion and a purpose in creating.
        </p>
        <p className="text-neutral-400 text-sm mb-6">
          Creating was my sanctuary and my expression. I decided to quit my role
          as Server Owner at Cloudcrux, and explore new avenues and
          possibilities. I devoted myself to music, art, photography, and video
          making, honing my skills and talents like never before.

          I created my first well-crafted song of my own in 2017. It was called
          GTA over a BlackCivic beat. 2018 was a tough but transformative year
          for me; I filmed my first music video that summer, flew to LA by
          myself, and upgraded my equipment with my own money.
        </p>
        <p className="text-neutral-400 text-sm mb-6">
          LA was an amazing trip that taught me how to depend on myself and
          collaborate with other talented music artists. We had a blast, just
          vibing, living, and creating. I was creating a catalyst.

            Ah! Hermes was created in 2012, but 2019 was when we turned it into
            a collective of local and international music artists and producers.
            We were a versatile group with different skills and talents. I was
            an engineer, videographer, and a facilitator who helped some members
            record and produce their music.

            My room became Tetra HQ, where we had meetings to inspire and
            support each other creatively. We also partnered with Audius to
            participate in virtual concerts and other platform features. It felt
            like we were exploring a new frontier after Soundcloud.

            In late 2019, I stepped on the stage for the first time in my life.
            It was one of the most exhilarating and unforgettable experiences I
            ever had. The event was a small one, organized by a friend of a
            friend. I was there as a photographer, capturing the moments of the
            other performers. But I also had a chance to showcase my own talent.
            I performed a feature that I had written and rehearsed. It was my
            only set, but Iâ€™m glad I did it. I felt a rush of adrenaline and joy
            as I shared my words with the audience.

            Timeless was created in 2019. It was one of the most ambitious
            projects started with me and my friends like brothers, Jay and
            Eddie. It had been a dream long before it became a reality. Take
            Initiative, Model Excellence, Live Efficient, Start Something. That
            was our motto. We wanted to brand ourselves in a way that reflected
            the authentic spirit of some young, hungry, New York natives. We
            learned how to screenprint from scratch, sold out every collection.
            I took most of the photos with my Canon. It was an unprecedented
            detour that truly paid off.

            The year 2019 marked the zenith of this epoch. After completing my
            education, I accelerated my ambitions. After the recharge I felt in
            going to LA the first time in 2018, I returned to the LA for the
            launch of Stay Sunny by Holland Izz, had a successful launch party
            for that as well. We founded Timeless in that same summer. When I
            came back to New York, we transformed Ah! Hermes into a formidable
            musical collective. It was a splendid culmination of what we had
            cultivated in the previous years.

            Throughout this year, I focused on creating cover artwork for

            still finding who I was at the time. I simply found it difficult to
            make art for myself, to express my own vision and feelings if it
            wasn't disguised through art I had done for others, but I was
            learning.

            This photo captures a moment when I was indulging in my passion for
            DIY fashion. I had a knack for transforming plain band t-shirts into
            unique and edgy pieces by bleaching and distressing them. I would
            resell the shirts on online platforms like Grailed and Mercari. At
            the time, I went over to Yeeev's crib to get some help to shoot the
            shirts, although many shots were left unused, there are still gem
            portraits from this day archived.
