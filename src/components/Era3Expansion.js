          The world was against me. It was a perilous time full of betrayals,
          deaths, and changes of values. I could hardly smile, chaos was
          everywhere. I started to hate school and the people around me, but
          nothing drove me more to create. Creating was my only escape. I had
          left my role as Server Owner at Cloudcrux, and began to focus on other
          things. I was more passionate about making music, networking for
          artwork, photography, and shooting videos than ever before.

          I created my first well-crafted song of my own in 2017. It was called
          GTA over a BlackCivic beat. 2018 was a tough but transformative year
          for me; I filmed my first music video that summer, flew to LA by
          myself, and upgraded my equipment with my own money. LA was an amazing
          trip that taught me how to depend on myself and collaborate with other
          talented music artists. We had a blast, just vibing, living, and
          creating. I was creating a catalyst.

          Ah! Hermes was created in 2012, but 2019 was when we turned it into a
          collective of local and international music artists and producers. We
          were a versatile group with different skills and talents. I was an
          engineer, videographer, and a facilitator who helped some members
          record and produce their music. My room became Tetra HQ, where we had
          meetings to inspire and support each other creatively. We also
          partnered with Audius to participate in virtual concerts and other
          platform features. It felt like we were exploring a new frontier after
          Soundcloud.

          In late 2019, I stepped on the stage for the first time in my life. It
          was one of the most exhilarating and unforgettable experiences I ever
          had. The event was a small one, organized by a friend of a friend. I
          was there as a photographer, capturing the moments of the other
          performers. But I also had a chance to showcase my own talent. I
          performed a feature that I had written and rehearsed. It was my only
          set, but Iâ€™m glad I did it. I felt a rush of adrenaline and joy as I
          shared my words with the audience.

          Timeless was created in 2019. It was one of the most ambitious
          projects started with me and my friends like brothers, Jay and Eddie.
          It had been a dream long before it became a reality. Take Initiative,
          Model Excellence, Live Efficient, Start Something. That was our motto.
          We wanted to brand ourselves in a way that reflected the authentic
          spirit of some young, hungry, New York natives. We learned how to
          screenprint from scratch, sold out every collection. I took most of
          the photos with my Canon. It was an unprecedented detour that truly
          paid off.

          This photo captures a moment when I was indulging in my passion for
          DIY fashion. I had a knack for transforming plain band t-shirts into
          unique and edgy pieces by bleaching and distressing them. I would
          resell the shirts on online platforms like Grailed and Mercari. At the
          time, I went over to Yeeev's crib to get some help to shoot the
          shirts, although many shots were left unused, there are still gem
          portraits from this day archived.

          The year 2019 marked the zenith of this epoch. After completing my
          education, I accelerated my ambitions. After the recharge I felt in
          going to LA the first time in 2018, I returned to the LA for the
          launch of Stay Sunny by Holland Izz, had a successful launch party for
          that as well. We founded Timeless in that same summer. When I came
          back to New York, we transformed Ah! Hermes into a formidable musical
          collective. It was a splendid culmination of what we had cultivated in
          the previous years.

          Throughout this year, I focused on creating cover artwork for various
          clients while also exploring other artistic mediums. This was a way to
          cope with my emotions and to divert my attention from my troubles. I
          found it difficult to make art for myself, to express my own vision
          and feelings if it wasn't disguised through art I had done for others.
